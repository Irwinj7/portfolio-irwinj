Hello and welcome to my portfolio! This project aws built to shwcase my skills in Javascript, CSS, and last but not least HTML. I built this webpage with the purpose of having a site to call my own, and to share with anybody when discussing my projects, not to mention future collaborations. I coded this webpage, not only with what we had learned in class, but with things I went off on my own to learn, as I believe there is no real way to ever stop learning about a subject, much less about programming in certain langauges.

The most abundant types of files in my portfolio were HTML files as i believe they are the face of the website and are what an average user will alwasy see first. Those files are Projects.html, about.html, contact.html. I also have a Images folder to make locating images used on the site easy to find. The style.css file is a long one, but goes in depth if you want to specifically change a certain section of a page, without affecting similar looking pages, and the javascript file is of course the main file for all funtions executed during the users time on my site.
